				RokkinCat is a Milwaukee-based and completely bootstrapped consulting firm focused on providing 
				high-skill (West Coast-level) engineering talent for local companies in need of new product development. 
				As one of the founders, I personally oversaw business operations, aided in growth strategies and executed 
				internal startups. During my time with the company, we successfully delivered more than 100 client projects. 
				We also supported the local startup community by consulting with new businesses for growth and execution.

				REX is an application that allows users to recommend anything and find recommendations from friends. 
				Starting as a web-only hybrid application (web code used to make a native-like app), I was brought in as 
				the key engineer to take the app from web-first to mobile-first, while also making it functional on 
				multiple platforms. The app is able to deliver updates in seconds without an approval process from the 
				App Store, which makes it much easier to make small-detail changes. I helped oversee setup of the beta testing 
				phase and, due to the quality of the beta delivered, investors went ahead with funding the app. Now available 
				to the public, REX currently has more than 45,000 registered users and has been used by influencers and 
				celebrities, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon/status/727194488884568064">Jimmy Fallon</a>.

				Comet.ai is a project-management tool that serves as a middle ground to connect all other project management tools. 
				Basically, the goal was to make it dead simple for project managers to see whatâ€™s going on in a project without requiring 
				each team member to use the exact same tools and processes. A single-page JavaScript application with an Elixir backend, 
				Comet.ai will eventually incorporate AI to better predict task completion times and assist project managers in following 
				up with team members. This software program was part of the <a href="http://wercbenchlabs.com/">WERCBench Labs</a> startup incubator in Summer 2015.
