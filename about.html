			<p class="portfolio--description">
				I am a full-stack developer with more than 13 years of engineering experience. 
				I'm a self-taught web programmer at age 14 and went on to earn degrees in Computer and 
				Software Engineering from the Milwaukee School of Engineering. I currently serve as 
				a founding partner of RokkinCat, a Milwaukee-based software consulting agency that works 
				with companies of all sizes – from startups to corporations – to help create new product 
				prototypes and businesses. In addition to RokkinCat, I helped incorporate three other 
				startup companies and successfully completed two accelerator programs (94Labs and WERCBench 
				abs). I am proficient in multiple programming languages including Ruby, HTML, Javascript 
				and CSS, and am passionate about collaborating with startups and other companies to help 
				them understand the ever-changing world of technology and how to apply it to their business 
				needs.
