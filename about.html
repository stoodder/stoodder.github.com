		<p class="about--description">
			I am a full-stack developer with more than 13 years of engineering experience. 
			I'm a self-taught web programmer at age 14 and went on to earn degrees in Computer and 
			Software Engineering from the Milwaukee School of Engineering. I currently serve as 
			a founding partner of RokkinCat, a Milwaukee-based software consulting agency that works 
			with companies of all sizes – from startups to corporations – to help create new product 
			prototypes and businesses. In addition to RokkinCat, I helped incorporate three other 
			startup companies and successfully completed two accelerator programs (94Labs and WERCBench 
			Labs). I am proficient in multiple programming languages including Ruby, HTML, Javascript 
			and CSS, and am passionate about collaborating with startups and other companies to help 
			them understand the ever-changing world of technology and how to apply it to their business 
			needs.
